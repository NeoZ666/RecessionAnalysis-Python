# RecessionAnalysis-Python
Using various US based macro-economic and financial data to predict timescales of recession. 

## Data Collection:-
This will primarily be a data analytics project where we will first research Household Financial Data dating back to 1950s.
This will include Government and Corporate Data backed with data from Independent Sources. 

## Data Inspection:-
Here, we will inspect our data for 
>Outliers
>Missing or Incomplete values
>Data that needs to be transformed or preprocessed so it's in the correct format to be used by your model

## Summary Statistics:-
Using summary statistics to understand the scope, scale, and shape of the dataset.
>[Statistics in Python with Scipy Lecture notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/packages/statistics/index.html)

>[Outlier detection in ML](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_outlier_detection_wine.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-applications-plot-outlier-detection-wine-py)

## Data Visualization:-
Using data visualization to see outliers and trends in our data and to help stakeholders understand the data. In this case, we will make logical sense of various Financial Statistics and their relevance to our model and how it's convergent to our findings.

## Model Building:-
We will use ML to give out predictions based on our data.
